# Project 1 - Relational Algebra

This project's goals were to replicate the 5 basic relational algebra operators in Java using the Table class provided to us. 

## Authors

- Jason Todd Maurer
- Thomas Nguyen

# Objective
- Implement and test five core RA operators: 'select', 'project', 'union', 'minus', and 'join'.   

# Key Features

- Select: Retrieves tuples based on specified conditions
- Project: Selects specific attributes from the tuples
- Union: Combines tuples from two tables without duplicates
- Minus: Removes tuples in the first table that also exist in the second table
- Join: Performs equi-joins, theta-joins and natural joins between tables based on matching attributes

# Key Goals
- Simulated basic database operations
- Build a foundational understanding of RA operators
- Ensure correct data manipulation and retrieval

# Significance
- Provides hands-on experience with core database operations
- Lays the groundwork for understanding more complext DBMS functionalities

# Prerequisites
- Before you begin, ensure you have me the following requirements:
- You have installed that latest version of Java
- You have a compatible IDE for Java development and testing

# Technologies Used
- Java 20
- VS Code
- Github
  
# Contributions
## Ridhima Reddy
## Curt Leonard
 Added the project function, using the Table classâ€™s method extract to extract the elements that matched the specified elements and add them to the new table returned. Also, added the typeCheck method, which needed to be implemented, and that checks if the number of elements in the tuple is the right number, and that each element is the right type as specified by the domain 
## Heeya Jolly
## Jason Maurer
Implemented all 3 join functions in src/Table.java

Added src/JoinTests.java to test these join functions
